    <h2>4. Future Experimental Directions</h2>

    <p>Based on the conformal-sector evidence presented, future experimental directions for testing the disformal sector are outlined below. Specifically, the "Anti-Echo" mechanism and the experimental requirements for future closed-loop time-transfer tests are described.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Conformal vs. Disformal: Two Distinct Predictions</h3>
    <p>The TEP bi-metric geometry $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi) \nabla_\mu\phi \nabla_\nu\phi$ contains two physically distinct coupling mechanisms:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Conformal Coupling $A(\phi)$:</strong> Modulates clock rates universally. Creates spatial correlations in timing residuals with length scale $\lambda \sim m_\phi^{-1}$. <em>This is the sector probed in GNSS and SLR analyses.</em></li>
        
        <li><strong>Disformal Coupling $B(\phi)$:</strong> Tilts photon light cones in directions transverse to $\nabla\phi$. Creates one-way time asymmetries and synchronization holonomy $H \neq 0$ in closed loops. <em>This requires closed-loop time transfer to test.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The multi-messenger constraint from GW170817 requires $|c_\gamma - c_g|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}$, forcing $B(\phi)(\partial\phi)^2 \approx 0$ today. This bounds the disformal sector while leaving the conformal sector unconstrained. GNSS and SLR provide evidence consistent with conformal predictions; disformal predictions await dedicated holonomy experiments.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Estimator-Dependent Sign Structure: The "Anti-Echo" Mechanism</h3>
    <p>Within the disformal sector, TEP predicts <em>estimator dependence</em>: the same underlying common-mode propagation delay can map differently into post-fit residuals depending on whether the estimator absorbs global modes into clocks (kinematic GNSS positioning) or into orbital parameters (dynamic SLR orbit determination).</p>

    <p>The mechanism operates as follows:</p>

    <div class="experimental-section">
        <p><strong>Schematic:</strong></p>
        <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 14px;">
            <li>GNSS (Kinematic PPP):  τ<sub>TEP</sub> → δt<sub>receiver</sub> → r > 0</li>
            <li>SLR (Dynamic OD):      τ<sub>TEP</sub> → δa<sub>orbit</sub>   → r < 0 (Predicted)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>GNSS (Kinematic PPP):</strong> In Precise Point Positioning, the receiver coordinates and clock bias are solved epoch-by-epoch. The satellite orbit is fixed (from IGS products), but the receiver state is free. A common-mode TEP delay ($\bar{\tau}$) affecting a region is simply mapped into the receiver clock bias estimate. Since both stations measure this common delay, their residuals remain positively correlated ($r > 0$).</li>
        
        <li><strong>SLR (Dynamic Orbit Determination):</strong> In SLR, a single orbital arc is fitted to observations from stations worldwide over several days. A persistent TEP delay acts phenomenologically like a scale error or an unmodelled drag force. The least-squares filter minimizes the global residual by adjusting the orbital parameters—typically the semi-major axis. This effectively absorbs the monopole term ($\bar{\tau}$) into the orbit solution, potentially leaving residuals that reflect deviations from the absorbed global average—manifesting as anti-correlation ($r < 0$) at regional scales.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Experimental Design Considerations</h3>
    <p>Monte Carlo simulations (see supplementary materials) demonstrate that estimator-dependent sign structure is plausible: when dynamic orbit fits absorb common-mode delays into orbital parameters, post-fit residual correlations can exhibit sign inversion at regional baselines. This provides the theoretical basis for future experimental designs.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Experimental Requirements for Testing the Anti-Echo</h3>
    <p>Detecting the "Anti-Echo" in real SLR data requires:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Dense Temporal Overlap:</strong> Synchronous observations from multiple stations within correlation timescales (~hours), not available in current ILRS cadence.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Estimator Comparison:</strong> Parallel processing with kinematic (epoch-by-epoch) and dynamic (arc-fit) estimators to isolate the sign-flip signature.</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative Orbit Solutions:</strong> Sensitivity analysis across different Analysis Center products (ASI, GFZ, CSR) to test monopole absorption consistency.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The current SLR dataset does not meet these requirements. Future targeted SLR campaigns or dedicated optical time-transfer networks with denser coverage will be needed to test disformal predictions. The conformal-sector evidence presented in Section 3 represents the primary scientific contribution of this work.</p>
