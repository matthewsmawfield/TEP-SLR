<h2>5. Observational Predictions: The Era of Chronometric Mapping</h2>

<p>The transition from a geometric to a dynamical-time framework shifts the observational focus from static shapes to dynamic arrival times. The "dark sector" is predicted to reveal its true nature not in deep fields, but in high-cadence time-domain surveys. Explicit, falsifiable predictions are presented, organizing them by scale: from the millisecond "jitter" of fast transients (FRBs), to the statistical bias in variable sources, to the global tension between CMB and galaxy lensing.</p>

<h3>5.1 The "Jittering" of Lensed Transients</h3>

<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> Strongly lensed fast transients (FRBs, GRBs) will exhibit achromatic arrival-time residuals that cannot be explained by geometric time delays (Refsdal 1964) or plasma dispersion.</p>
<p>In standard GR, the time delay \(\Delta t_{geom}\) between images is fixed by the mass distribution. In TEP, there is an additional proper-time delay \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}\). Because \(\phi\) fields in halos may have substructure (or "weather"), this delay varies across the image plane. For a millisecond-duration FRB (e.g., Muñoz et al. 2016), even a tiny gradient in \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}\) will manifest as a timing anomaly. Unlike plasma dispersion (which scales as \(\nu^{-2}\)), this delay is <em>achromatic</em>. A detection of non-dispersive, millisecond-scale residuals in lensed FRBs would constitute a definitive signature of TEP.</p>

<h3>5.2 The Variability Bias Relation</h3>

<p><strong>Prediction:</strong> The inferred weak-lensing shear should correlate with the variability of the background source population.</p>
<p>As derived in Section 3, the "phantom mass" effect is driven by the <em>Temporal Shear Tensor</em> \(\mathcal{T}_{shear}\), which depends on the total source variation (intrinsic evolution + proper motion). A specific test using existing cluster fields is outlined (e.g., Abell 370): construct two independent shear maps of the same cluster. Map A uses only passive elliptical galaxies (dominated by proper motion variability). Map B uses only intrinsically variable sources (quasars, lensed supernovae). TEP predicts a systematic excess convergence in Map B due to the additional intrinsic term \(\partial I_s/\partial t\), whereas particle dark matter predicts identical maps. Future surveys (LSST/Rubin) will have the cadence to test this "Variability Bias," potentially falsifying the particle hypothesis.</p>

<h3>5.3 The CMB-Galaxy Lensing Tension</h3>

<p><strong>Prediction (Extended Regime):</strong> Lensing inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) should differ systematically from lensing inferred from galaxy shear.</p>
<p>While the CMB is effectively a static backlight (zero intrinsic evolution), the intervening structures (the lenses) are moving dynamically across the line of sight. Under TEP, the rapid transit of a lens's "time gradient" \(\nabla(\Delta\tilde{\tau})\) across a static background induces a temporal shear similar to the <em>Rees-Sciama effect</em>, but amplified by the conformal factor. Consequently, TEP predicts that CMB lensing <em>exists</em> and correlates with structure, driven by lens motion. However, galaxy lensing includes an <em>additional</em> constructive contribution from the intrinsic evolution of the source galaxies (\(\partial I_s / \partial t\)). This asymmetry predicts a systematic tension in the inferred amplitude of clustering (\(S_8\)) between CMB lensing (lens-motion only) and galaxy weak lensing (lens-motion + source-evolution), offering a physical resolution to the observed \(S_8\) tension.</p>

<h3>5.4 Comparison of Predictions: TEP-GL vs. Particle Dark Matter</h3>

<p>The following table summarizes the distinguishing predictions of the two frameworks:</p>

<p>The critical discriminant is the <em>source-dependence</em> of the inferred dark component. Particle dark matter lenses all sources identically; TEP-GL predicts that the apparent "dark" signal depends on the variability timescale of the background source.</p>

<h3>5.5 Falsification Criteria</h3>

<p>TEP-GL is a falsifiable hypothesis. The following observations would exclude specific regimes or the framework entirely:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Reference Envelope Exclusion:</strong> If precision timing of strongly lensed FRBs yields achromatic residuals consistent with zero to better than 0.1 ms across diverse lens environments, the <strong>Reference Envelope</strong> parameter space is excluded.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Source-Independent Shear:</strong> If weak-lensing shear measurements behind clusters show no correlation with source variability class (static ellipticals vs. variable AGN) after controlling for redshift and morphology, the temporal-composite mechanism is excluded.</li>

    <li><strong>CMB-Galaxy Agreement:</strong> If future surveys (e.g., CMB-S4, Rubin/LSST) demonstrate that CMB lensing and galaxy weak-lensing mass inferences agree to better than 1% after controlling for all modeling systematics, the <strong>Extended Regime</strong> parameter space is excluded.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Chromatic Anomaly:</strong> If any timing or morphological anomaly shows wavelength dependence after correction for plasma dispersion and dust, the achromatic prediction of two-metric coupling is falsified. This would indicate conventional astrophysical systematics rather than metric effects.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Direct Detection:</strong> A confirmed detection of dark matter particles in direct-detection experiments would establish the existence of a particulate dark sector. TEP would then be relegated to a sub-dominant correction rather than a primary explanation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The framework stands or falls on empirical grounds. It does not claim immunity from observation; the claim is that the observations required to test TEP have not yet been performed with sufficient precision.</p>
