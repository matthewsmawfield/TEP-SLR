<h2>6. Discussion: A Paradigm Shift in the Dark Sector</h2>

<h3>6.1 Limitations of the "Stack of Corrections"</h3>

<p>Gravitational physics has historically advanced by refining the fundamental geometric framework rather than adding ad-hoc corrections. TEP represents a similar upgrade to the fundamental object, following the natural historical progression of physical theory:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Newton:</strong> Gravity is a Force; Time is Absolute.</li>
    <li><strong>Einstein:</strong> Gravity is Geometry; Time is Relative (Coordinate-Dependent).</li>
    <li><strong>TEP:</strong> Gravity is Geometry; Time is a <em>Dynamical Field</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>By treating the rate of proper time accumulation as a physical field with its own degrees of freedom (rather than a fixed function of the metric), TEP unifies the "stack" into a single framework. The "dark matter" anomaly is simply the observation that this field has spatial gradients.</p>

<h3>6.2 Interpretational Challenges</h3>

<p>TEP effects mimic standard lensing signatures, making them difficult to distinguish without time-domain analysis.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Static Degeneracy:</strong> Most lensing data are analyzed under static assumptions. In this limit, temporal shear is mathematically indistinguishable from spatial mass (Section 3).</li>
    <li><strong>Differential vs. Common-Mode Effects:</strong> The GW170817 constraint is often interpreted as excluding modified metric couplings. However, as shown in Section 4, this constraint applies to the differential disformal sector. Conformal proper-time dilation is a <em>common-mode effect</em> for co-propagating signals, leaving the "speed of gravity" constraint satisfied while permitting significant time-domain phenomenology.</li>
</ol>

<h3>6.3 Reinterpreting the Evidence: Multipath vs. Single-Path</h3>

<p>When viewed through the lens of TEP, the disparate constraints on the dark sector resolve into a consistent picture based on signal topology:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Lensing (Multipath):</strong> Observations that require "dark matter" (e.g., lensing) are fundamentally <em>multipath</em> measurements. These different pathways sample different values of the time field \(\phi\), creating differential delays that manifest as "phantom mass."</li>
    <li><strong>GW170817 (Single-Path):</strong> Observations that constrain "modified gravity" (GW170817) are fundamentally <em>single-path</em> measurements. The signals originate from the same coordinate and traverse the same time-warped regions. The temporal distortions are common-mode and cancel out.</li>
</ul>

<p>The apparent contradiction—"how can gravity be modified enough to create dark matter but unmodified enough to pass GW170817?"—is resolved. Gravity may not be modified; time is. And time manifests as a differential observable only when comparing divergent paths.</p>

<h3>6.4 Global Variation of Effective Light Speed</h3>

<p>If TEP is correct, then \(c\) is locally invariant but globally variable. This challenges the foundational assumption used to interpret all astrophysical data.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Standard Assumption:</strong> \(c\) is constant; therefore, any anomaly in \(t\) must be due to extra path length (spatial curvature) or extra mass (Shapiro delay). Conclusion: <em>dark matter</em> exists.</li>
    <li><strong>TEP Reality:</strong> \(t\) is modulated by the field \(\sqrt{A(\phi)}\); \(c\) is effectively variable along the path. The anomaly in \(t\) is due to the scalar field gradient. Conclusion: <em>dark matter</em> admits the interpretation of variable light speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>TEP removes the need for an invisible substance by correcting the assumption about the constancy of the global speed of light.</p>

<h3>6.5 TEP as a Bridge Between Paradigms</h3>

<p>TEP offers a potential unification of competing frameworks:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CDM:</strong> In the limit where the scalar field \(\phi\) relaxes into stable halos and source variability is ignored, TEP reproduces the phenomenology of Cold Dark Matter (via the Phantom Mass mechanism).</li>
    <li><strong>MOND:</strong> In the regime of low acceleration (large gradients in \(\phi\)), TEP reproduces the scaling relations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics without modifying Newton's laws, but by modifying the clock metric.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, TEP is not merely a competitor to these paradigms; it is a framework that explains <em>why</em> CDM works on large scales (where static assumptions hold) and <em>why</em> MOND works on galactic scales (where the field gradients are dominant).</p>

<h3>6.6 The Path Forward</h3>

<p>The analysis suggests that <em>dark matter phenomenology can be reproduced without a substance</em>. What exists is a temporal field with spatial gradients, and what has been measured as "dark matter" is the projection of those gradients onto observations that assume temporal synchrony. To maintain the particle interpretation, it is necessary to demonstrate that the universe is synchronous to a precision that excludes TEP effects. TEP offers a geometric identification of the phenomenology, explaining the universality of dark matter profiles and the success of MOND on galactic scales through a single parsimonious framework.</p>

<p>"Dark Time" is not merely an alternative to dark matter; it offers a geometric identification of the phenomenology that admits this interpretation.</p>
