<h2>2. Theoretical Framework</h2>

<h3>2.1 The Two-Metric Postulate</h3>

<p>The gravitational interaction and the matter sector are posited to be governed by distinct metrics related by a scalar field \(\phi\). The <em>Gravitational Metric</em> \(g_{\mu\nu}\) determines the geodesics of macroscopic test masses and the causal structure of gravitational waves. The <em>Matter Metric</em> \(\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}\) determines the behavior of standard model fields, atomic clocks, and electromagnetic propagation. The general two-metric relation (Bekenstein 1993) is adopted:</p>

<div class="equation">$$\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi)\partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi$$</div>

<p>Here, \(\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}\) is the metric measured by atomic clocks (matter sector) and \(g_{\mu\nu}\) is the metric governing gravitational geodesics. The function \(A(\phi)\) defines the <em>Conformal Sector</em> (isotropic scaling of proper time/length) and \(B(\phi)\) defines the <em>Disformal Sector</em> (anisotropic stretching along field gradients). This structure represents a modification of measurement rather than a modification of gravity. All physical rulers and clocks are built from matter coupled to \(\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}\), while the "force" of gravity is mediated by \(g_{\mu\nu}\).</p>

<h3>2.2 The Optical Theory of Gravity</h3>

<p>A unified "Optical Theory" of dark matter is developed here, where the phenomenology arises from two distinct optical effects of the scalar field \(A(\phi)\): a static refractive index and a dynamic shutter.</p>

<h4>1. The Static Refractive Index (Geometric Lensing)</h4>
<p>The scalar field acts as a locally variable optical factor \(n_{eff} \approx \sqrt{A(\phi)}\) in the travel-time functional governing image formation. The associated excess matter proper-time delay is:</p>
<div class="equation">$$\Delta \tilde{\tau}_{\rm static} = \frac{1}{c} \int (\sqrt{A(\phi)} - 1)\, dl$$</div>
<p>This <em>Static Halo</em> contributes a source-independent term to the arrival-time (Fermat) surface. In multipath configurations, it is therefore operationally degenerate with the "bulk" convergence inferred in standard reconstructions (Einstein rings, major arcs), even though in the conformal limit it preserves null cones and does not generate a differential photon–graviton speed.</p>

<h4>2. The Dynamic Shutter (Temporal Lensing)</h4>
<p>While the static term shifts the arrival-time surface, the gradient of the differential delay field \(\nabla(\Delta \tilde{\tau})\) acts as a "shutter" that modulates the arrival time of photons from different parts of the source. For a source with evolution or motion, this creates a <em>Temporal Shear</em>:</p>
<div class="equation">$$\mathcal{T}_{shear} \propto \left(\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} + \vec{v}_s \cdot \nabla I\right) \nabla(\Delta \tilde{\tau})$$</div>
<p>This <em>Dynamic Shutter</em> explains the anomalies—the "phantom mass" that appears to fluctuate with source type. It operates as a re-ordering of wavefronts in time rather than a deflection of rays. Crucially, this effect applies even to "static" sources (like elliptical galaxies) due to their proper motion \(\vec{v}_s\) across the delay gradient. (See Section 3 for the full derivation).</p>

<p>Together, these two mechanisms constitute the TEP framework: the refractive index replaces the dark matter halo, and the dynamic shutter replaces the "complexity" of substructure.</p>

<h3>2.3 Operational Axioms: The TEP Framework</h3>

<p>The TEP framework rests on four foundational axioms. These are not approximations or perturbative corrections to General Relativity; they constitute a complete operational framework for interpreting gravitational phenomenology. They are adopted as <em>primary postulates</em> from which observational consequences are derived:</p>

<div class="principle">
<p><strong>Axiom 1 (Causal Universality):</strong> In the Conformal Limit (\(B=0\)), the null cones of \(g_{\mu\nu}\) and \(\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}\) are identical. Photons and gravitational waves follow the same null geodesics. No "speed of light" difference exists in this limit. <em>This axiom is exact, not approximate.</em></p>

<p><strong>Axiom 2 (Proper Time Primacy):</strong> The fundamental observable in any timing measurement is the accumulated matter proper time \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}\) along the signal path. Coordinate time differences \(\Delta t\) are not observables; they are inferred quantities dependent on the metric model. <em>This axiom establishes proper time as the irreducible physical observable; all other timing quantities are derived.</em></p>

<p><strong>Axiom 3 (Time-Transport Holonomy):</strong> For any signal trajectory \(\gamma\) connecting a fixed emission event to an observation event, define the time-transport functional \(\mathcal{T}[\gamma] \equiv \Delta\tilde{\tau}[\gamma]\), the matter proper-time delay registered by an atomic clock. For two alternative trajectories \(\gamma_1,\gamma_2\), the closed-loop holonomy for the loop \(C = \gamma_1 \circ \gamma_2^{-1}\) is \(\mathcal{H}[C] \equiv \mathcal{T}[\gamma_1] - \mathcal{T}[\gamma_2]\). This holonomy is the invariant discriminator: it is directly observable (multi-image transients, strong-lens time delays) and cannot be reduced to a coordinate “speed” parameter. In the conformal limit, \(d\tilde{\tau} = \sqrt{A(\phi)} d\tau_g\) is common-mode for co-propagating messengers; disformal coupling contributes the genuinely path-dependent component that generates differential delays across an image plane. <em>This axiom formalizes TEP as an operational theory of time transport: the observable content lives in holonomies of \(\mathcal{T}[\gamma]\), not in inferred coordinate-time constructs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Axiom 4 (Operational Constraint Mapping):</strong> The translation from observed arrival-time offsets to inferred propagation-speed bounds is theory-dependent. Existing multi-messenger constraints (e.g., GW170817) are interpreted within the standard framework that assumes a single metric governs all sectors. In the TEP framework, these constraints apply to specific parameter combinations (primarily the disformal sector) and do not constitute blanket exclusions of two-metric effects. <em>This axiom establishes that constraints derived under Isochrony-assuming frameworks must be re-derived operationally within TEP before being applied as exclusions.</em></p>
 </div>
 
 <p>These axioms are mutually consistent and together define the TEP interpretation of gravitational phenomenology. They replace the implicit Isochrony Axiom of standard lensing analysis with an explicit dynamical-time framework.</p>

 <p><strong>The Hidden Closure in Standard Practice:</strong> In addition to the Isochrony Axiom, most observational inference quietly assumes that time transport is globally integrable: after correcting for known effects (Sagnac, Shapiro, troposphere, etc.), a single global time coordinate can be assigned such that closed-loop synchronization holonomy vanishes. Operationally, this is the step that licenses the non-local conversion \(d = c\,t\) and the inference “timing residual \(\Rightarrow\) mass residual.” In TEP, this closure is not assumed; it is replaced by Axiom 3, which treats the loop holonomy \(\mathcal{H}[C]\) as the invariant object that can, in principle, be non-zero.</p>
 
 <h3>2.4 Conformal vs. Disformal Phenomenology</h3>

<p>The distinction between the two sectors is critical for interpreting multi-messenger constraints, and it rests on a fundamental distinction between <em>Single-Path</em> and <em>Multipath</em> measurements. Furthermore, it necessitates a redefinition of the "speed of light":</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Conformal Sector (\(A(\phi)\)):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Preserves angles and null cones. \(\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu = A g_{\mu\nu}k^\mu k^\nu = 0\).</li>
            <li><strong>Local Invariance vs. Global Variability:</strong> While \(c\) is locally invariant (measured as \(299,792,458\) m/s by any local clock), the <em>global effective speed</em> is variable. Because the rate of proper time accumulation \(d\tilde{\tau} = \sqrt{A(\phi)} d\tau_g\) varies with location, the time required to traverse a fixed spatial interval depends on the scalar field value. To an observer assuming a universal clock, light appears to speed up or slow down depending on the path.</li>
            <li><strong>Single-Path Physics (GW170817):</strong> Photons and gravitational waves from the exact same source coordinate follow the <em>same</em> null geodesic. Any temporal distortion \(A(\phi)\) along this path is common-mode. The signals do not diverge because they share the same history.</li>
            <li><strong>Multipath Physics (Lensing):</strong> Gravitational lensing involves light rays taking <em>different</em> paths around a mass distribution. These paths traverse different regions of the scalar field \(\phi(\vec{x})\). The differential time dilation between these paths creates the "dark matter" signature.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Disformal Sector (\(B(\phi)\)):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Tilts null cones. The effective speed of light differs from the speed of gravity: \(c_{\gamma} \neq c_g\).</li>
            <li><strong>Observables:</strong> Differential arrival times between species, constrained by GW170817 to \(|c_{\gamma}-c_g|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}\) for the path-averaged monopole.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2.5 The "Phantom Mass" Mechanism</h3>

<p>Standard lensing reconstruction solves for a mass distribution \(\Sigma(\vec{\theta})\) that reproduces the observed image distortions. This reconstruction assumes the Isochrony Axiom: \(I_{obs}(\vec{\theta}) = I_{src}(\vec{\beta})\). However, in the TEP framework, the image is a temporal integral:</p>

<div class="equation">$$I_{obs}(\vec{\theta}) = \int I_{src}(\vec{\beta}, t - \Delta \tilde{\tau}(\vec{\theta})) \, dt$$</div>

<p>where \(\Delta \tilde{\tau}(\vec{\theta})\) is the excess proper time delay along the line of sight at image position \(\vec{\theta}\). For a spatially varying conformal coupling, this delay varies across the image plane. If the source has temporal variability (secular evolution, rotation, or fluctuations) on the timescale of \(\nabla_\theta (\Delta \tilde{\tau})\), the resulting image is smeared.</p>

<p><strong>The Equivalence:</strong> A gradient in arrival time across an image is mathematically equivalent to a shearing of the source frame. To a static observer assuming isochrony, this "temporal shear" is indistinguishable from the "gravitational shear" caused by mass. Thus, <em>purely temporal structure is misinterpreted as "Phantom Mass" (dark matter).</em></p>

<h3>2.6 Two Regimes of TEP-GL</h3>

<div class="principle">
<p><strong>Box 1: The Two Observational Regimes</strong></p>

<p>The TEP-GL framework operates in two distinct regimes, distinguished by the magnitude of the differential proper-time delay \(\Delta\tilde{\tau}\) across the lens:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Regime I: The Reference Envelope</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Assumption (Standard):</strong> The GW170817 multi-messenger timing constraint applies to all metric sectors equally.</li>
    <li><strong>Constraint basis:</strong> The standard translation of timing to propagation-speed bounds (\(\lesssim 10^{-15}\)).</li>
    <li><strong>Delay scale:</strong> \(\Delta\tilde{\tau} \sim 10^{-3}\text{--}1\) s (milliseconds to seconds) on halo scales.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary observables:</strong> Time-domain signatures in rapidly varying sources—lensed FRBs, GRBs.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark matter status:</strong> TEP is a <em>precision systematic</em> in time-delay cosmography, not a wholesale DM replacement.</li>
    <li><strong>Falsification:</strong> Null detection of achromatic timing residuals at &lt; 0.1 ms excludes this regime.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Regime II: The Extended Regime</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Assumption (Sector Decoupling):</strong> GW170817 constrains only differential disformal coupling; conformal temporal structure is unconstrained (see Axiom 4).</li>
    <li><strong>Delay scale:</strong> \(\Delta\tilde{\tau} \sim 10^{3}\text{--}10^{5}\) years, driven by the conformal factor \(A(\phi)\) integrated along cosmological paths.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary observables:</strong> The full phenomenology of "dark matter" in lensing—cluster arcs, cosmic shear.</li>
    <li><strong>Dark matter status:</strong> Dark matter is modeled as a measurement artifact. The \(\phi\) field constitutes the underlying reality.</li>
    <li><strong>Falsification:</strong> CMB-galaxy lensing agreement at &lt; 1%; no source-variability correlation in shear.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This work demonstrates that <em>the Extended Regime (Regime II) is a viable physical alternative</em>. The Reference Envelope (Regime I) is a useful conservative baseline for calibration, but it represents a scenario where the temporal field is artificially suppressed to match constraints that do not actually apply to the conformal sector.</p>

<h3>2.7 Why Lensing May Not Be Purely Spatial</h3>

<p>Standard gravitational lensing analysis contains a simplifying temporal assumption that has typically been treated as exact. This assumption is made explicit, and its breakdown under TEP leads directly to the dark matter reinterpretation.</p>

<h4>The Hidden Assumption in Image Formation</h4>

<p>When a lensed galaxy is observed, photons are collected over an exposure time and an "image" is reconstructed. This reconstruction implicitly assumes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>All photons arriving during the exposure left the source at approximately the same epoch</li>
    <li>Differences in arrival angles correspond to differences in spatial paths, not temporal paths</li>
    <li>The reconstructed "shape" represents a spatial snapshot of the source at one moment</li>
</ol>

<p>These assumptions constitute the <em>Isochrony Axiom</em> applied to image formation. Standard analysis corrects for the mean lookback time (distance), but assumes that the variance in lookback time across the image is negligible. This overlooked variance is defined as <em>Differential Lookback Time</em>. In a two-metric framework, this variance is not negligible; it is the dominant source of the observed distortion.</p>

<h4>The Temporal Composite Mechanism</h4>

<p>Consider an extended galaxy being lensed. Light from different parts of the galaxy:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Leaves the source at different times (the source is evolving on Myr timescales)</li>
    <li>Takes different paths through the lens (different impact parameters)</li>
    <li>Accumulates time differently through regions with different \(A(\phi)\) values</li>
    <li>Arrives at the detector at the "same" observation time</li>
</ul>

<p>If \(A(\phi)\) varies spatially—forming a halo-like configuration around the lens—then:</p>

<div class="equation">$$\Delta t_{\rm path} = \int_{\rm path} \frac{\sqrt{A(\phi)}}{c}\,dl$$</div>

<p>differs between rays at different impact parameters. For cosmological propagation distances \(L \sim\) Gpc and conformal variations \(\Delta A/A \sim 10^{-6}\text{--}10^{-4}\), the differential delay is:</p>

<div class="equation">$$\Delta t \sim \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta A}{A} \cdot \frac{L}{c} \sim 10^3\text{--}10^5 \text{ years}$$</div>

<p>This is <em>long enough that the source has evolved</em>. The inner parts of the lensed image show the galaxy from an earlier epoch; the outer parts show it from a later epoch. The observation is not a spatial snapshot—it is a <em>temporal composite</em>.</p>

<h4>Why This Creates "Phantom Mass"</h4>

<p>For a source that evolves on timescales comparable to \(\Delta t\):</p>

<ul>
    <li>If the source was more compact in the past → inner regions (earlier epoch) appear smaller</li>
    <li>If the source was less compact in the past → inner regions appear larger</li>
    <li>The reconstructed "shape" is systematically distorted by temporal mixing</li>
</ul>

<p>Standard lensing analysis interprets <em>any</em> systematic shape distortion as evidence for mass (convergence and shear). The temporal smearing is mathematically indistinguishable from gravitational lensing distortion. What has been interpreted as "dark matter" may be, in whole or in part, <em>temporal depth projected onto the spatial image plane</em>.</p>

<h4>Why This Effect Is Achromatic</h4>

<p>The conformal factor \(A(\phi)\) rescales proper time identically for all photon frequencies. Unlike plasma dispersion (which scales as \(\nu^{-2}\)) or dust extinction (wavelength-dependent), conformal temporal coupling is <em>perfectly achromatic</em>. This explains why gravitational lensing appears achromatic—not because there is gravitating mass, but because the temporal field affects all wavelengths equally.</p>

<h4>The Central Thesis</h4>

<p>Under TEP, the existence of "dark matter" is inferred rather than directly observed. It is a <em>conclusion contingent on the Isochrony Axiom</em>. If that axiom fails—if the universe is not temporally synchronous in the way standard analysis assumes—then the inferred "dark mass" can be modeled as unmodeled temporal structure. The dark sector is modeled not as a substance, but as the shadow of time. No claim is made regarding uniqueness of the two-metric realization, only the operational equivalence of temporal gradients to inferred mass under isochrony.</p>
