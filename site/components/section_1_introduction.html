<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1 The Anomaly of the Dark Sector</h2>

<p>The existence of dark matter, inferred from gravitational lensing (Walsh et al. 1979), cluster dynamics (Zwicky 1933), and cosmic microwave background observations (Planck Collaboration 2020), represents a significant challenge in modern physics. Despite decades of increasingly sensitive searches, no dark matter particle has been directly detected (Schumann 2019), and tensions persist between cosmological observations at different scales (Riess et al. 2022; Di Valentino et al. 2021). The prevailing paradigm assumes that these anomalies indicate the presence of an invisible <em>substance</em>. The question arises whether the apparent mass discrepancy can be resolved by relaxing the <em>Isochrony Axiom</em>—the assumption that temporal delays across an image are negligible.</p>

<p>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (Milgrom 1983) and its relativistic extensions (Bekenstein 2004; Skordis &amp; Złośnik 2021) have challenged the dark matter hypothesis by modifying the gravitational force law. However, these approaches typically retain the standard metric assumptions regarding light propagation and causality. The present analysis interrogates a deeper, often unstated assumption underlying the interpretation of all astronomical signals: the nature of simultaneity in image formation.</p>

<h2>1.2 The Isochrony Axiom</h2>

<p>Gravitational lensing is universally treated as the spatial deflection of light rays by mass. This geometric interpretation relies on an implicit but foundational axiom:</p>

<div class="principle">
<p><strong>The Isochrony Axiom:</strong> The observational approximation that the exposure time is much shorter than any differential delay across the source, such that all photons collected can be treated as originating from a single, synchronous epoch.</p>
</div>

<p>While this axiom serves as a necessary simplification for standard analysis, it breaks down when the differential lookback time across an image becomes comparable to the evolutionary timescale of the source. Standard analysis corrects for the finite speed of light in the arrival time of signals (lookback time) but has typically neglected the finite <em>variance</em> of that speed across the image plane (differential lookback time). In the presence of generalized metric couplings, this approximation fails. Gravitational lensing is fundamentally an <em>arrival-time</em> phenomenon. Images form at the stationary points of the Fermat potential, which encodes the total light-travel time (Blandford &amp; Narayan 1986). In standard General Relativity, the difference in arrival times between images is attributed solely to geometric path differences and the Shapiro delay caused by mass. However, if the coupling between matter and gravity involves a second metric—specifically one that affects matter-clock rates or light-cone tilts—the arrival times of photons can be decoupled from the geometric definitions of "mass" used in standard GR.</p>

<p>If the Isochrony Axiom is violated, an observed "image" is not a snapshot of the source at one moment, but a <em>temporal composite</em>. Photons arriving at the same detector time may have left the source at significantly different emission times. For an evolving source, this temporal smearing is mathematically indistinguishable from a spatial distortion (convergence and shear) in a static reconstruction. What is interpreted as "dark matter" may be the projection of this temporal depth onto the spatial image plane.</p>

<h2>1.3 The Interpretive Bifurcation</h2>

<p>Consider two mathematically equivalent interpretations of the same Fermat potential surface, distinguished only by their treatment of simultaneity:</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation A (Standard Framework):</strong> Assumes the Isochrony Axiom. An Einstein ring is analyzed with apparent convergence \(\kappa_{\rm obs}\) exceeding what the visible baryonic mass can produce. A dark matter halo with mass \(M_{\rm DM} = M_{\rm obs} - M_{\rm baryons}\) is inferred. The "dark matter" is treated as an unseen substance required to explain the lensing geometry.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation B (TEP Framework):</strong> Rejects the Isochrony Axiom. The observed image is recognized as a <em>temporal composite</em>: photons arriving simultaneously at the detector left the source at different emission epochs, with differential delays set by the two-metric structure along each ray. For an evolving source, this temporal depth projects onto the image plane as an apparent spatial distortion. The differential proper-time accumulation across the lens is computed, and the "excess convergence" is identified as the signature of temporal-field gradients \(\nabla\phi\) in the lens environment. The "dark matter" is reinterpreted not as a substance, but as the shadow of unmodeled time.</p>

<p><strong>The Critical Point:</strong> Both frameworks fit the data equally well. The difference is not observational but <em>interpretive</em>—it depends on which axiom (Isochrony vs. TEP) is taken as fundamental. The two frameworks become distinguishable only when tested against observables that break the degeneracy: time-domain signatures in rapidly varying sources, achromatic residual timing anomalies across multiple images, and the correlation of inferred "dark" components with source evolution timescales.</p>

<p>This bifurcation illustrates that the existence of "dark matter" is a conclusion contingent on the Isochrony Axiom. If that axiom is false, the conclusion does not necessarily follow.</p>

<h2>1.4 The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP)</h2>

<p>The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP), introduced in a companion paper (Smawfield 2025a), represents a shift in fundamental perspective, replacing the standard geometric framework with an operational one:</p>

<div class="principle">
<p><strong>Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP):</strong> The operative physical observable in any non-local measurement is the accumulated matter proper time along worldlines and signal paths. Under TEP, "gravity" includes the phenomenology of differential proper-time accumulation. The decomposition of this accumulation into "spatial curvature" (mass) and "temporal dilation" (metric coupling) is gauge-dependent; only the total integrated proper time is invariant.</p>
</div>

<p>Under TEP, the central question is not "how much mass is bending the light?" but "what is the total proper-time history of the signal?" In the conformal-only limit of a two-metric theory, null cones are preserved, meaning the "speed of light" is unchanged, yet the <em>rate</em> of proper time accumulation varies. This creates a disconnect between the "gravitational metric" (which governs orbital mechanics) and the "matter metric" (which governs atomic clocks and photon frequencies).</p>

<h2>1.5 Redefining the Dark Sector</h2>

<p>This paper develops the TEP framework to show that two-metric temporal coupling can reproduce the phenomenology of dark matter in gravitational lensing without invisible mass. It is demonstrated that:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>The "dark" signal is a temporal artifact:</strong> In a spatially varying conformal field, lens-local differential delays create temporal-composite images. When interpreted through standard static lens models (which assume Isochrony), these delays manifest as apparent additional convergence and shear—"phantom mass."</li>
    <li><strong>GW170817 is a differential constraint:</strong> The multi-messenger constraint \(|c_{\gamma}-c_g|/c \lesssim 10^{-15}\) is explicitly reanalyzed. It is shown that this bounds only the <em>disformal</em> (cone-tilt) component of the coupling. The <em>conformal</em> component, which governs clock rates and drives the "dark matter" phenomenology, is unconstrained because photons and gravitational waves share the same null cone and thus experience common-mode dilation.</li>
    <li><strong>The Reference Envelope vs. The Reality:</strong> The standard translation of GW170817 timing to propagation-speed bounds is treated as a conservative <strong>Reference Envelope</strong> for the disformal sector. However, for the unconstrained conformal sector, it is demonstrated that the temporal-field gradients required to reproduce lensing anomalies are physically viable. This transforms the "dark matter problem" from a search for particles into a search for unmodeled temporal structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>By abandoning the Isochrony Axiom, the dark matter problem is transformed from a search for missing particles into a search for unmodeled temporal structure. The parameter space where this structure masquerades as dark matter is defined, offering a falsifiable alternative to the particle paradigm.</p>

<p>The TEP thesis holds that what is conventionally called "dark matter" can be modeled as temporal structure—the accumulated effect of unmodeled proper-time variations across lensing observations. The particle interpretation serves as an effective model under the assumption of synchrony. TEP does not posit an alternative substance; it holds that the phenomenology traditionally attributed to dark matter may be better understood as a metric artifact.</p>
