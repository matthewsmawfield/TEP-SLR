    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

    <p>This study presents an independent optical-domain test of the Temporal Equivalence Principle's conformal sector using Satellite Laser Ranging. By analyzing 11 years of LAGEOS data, a spatially coherent residual structure has been isolated that mirrors the conformal signatures observed in microwave GNSS networks (Smawfield 2025b, 2025c, 2025d; Papers 1-3). The analysis identifies a path-length dependent temporal contrast in a gap-aware lag-1 diagnostic (treated conservatively due to threshold sensitivity) and a strong spectral concentration (14.00× enhancement in the TEP band relative to broadband, 95% CI: 13.53–14.47). The observation of matching low-frequency structure in a system devoid of active clocks and microwave transmission challenges hypotheses that rely on microwave-specific receiver electronics, clock steering, or ionospheric modeling.</p>

    <p>Taken together with the GNSS results, the SLR evidence is consistent with the conformal-sector interpretation across five orders of magnitude in frequency (microwave to optical) and across two independent measurement technologies (GNSS and SLR). The observed correlation length in GNSS ($\lambda = 4,201 \pm 1,967$ km) and the SLR path-length dependent diagnostic (over a $\sim 3{,}000$ km path difference between the high- and low-range selections) are both consistent with Vainshtein screening at the dark energy scale ($m_\phi \approx 5 \times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$).</p>

    <p>In the inter-station domain, the sparse ILRS cadence limits synchronous overlap; however, by employing daily aggregation and widened contemporaneous windows, statistically significant distance-structured correlations have been detected ($p=0.004$ for pass-bin analysis; $p=0.017$ for daily aggregation). While the signal is complex and geometry-dependent (driven by LAGEOS-2), its detection indicates that the low-frequency structure observed in single-station spectra is spatially coherent. Furthermore, this phenomenology offers a unified physical explanation for persistent geodetic anomalies, including the ITRF2020 VLBI-SLR scale drift and the pervasive "flicker noise" floor in station coordinates, reinterpreting them as evidence of conformal metric coupling rather than intractable systematics.</p>

    <p>The evidence presented here is consistent with a conformal-sector signal across two independent measurement systems, multiple processing centers, long-term GNSS stability, raw observational data, and the full electromagnetic spectrum. The "Time Echo" is not readily explained as a single-technology artifact; it appears as a reproducible low-frequency structure in geodetic residuals consistent with universal conformal coupling to a dynamical time field. Future experiments—closed-loop optical time transfer, interplanetary one-way asymmetry measurements, and triangle synchronization holonomy tests—will determine whether the disformal sector also manifests in nature or remains a theoretical possibility bounded to negligibility by multi-messenger constraints.</p>
