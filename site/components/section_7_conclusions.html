<h2>7. Conclusions</h2>

<h3>7.1 Limitations of the Isochrony Axiom</h3>

<p>For nearly a century, the dark matter paradigm has rested on a single, simplifying assumption: that the observed universe is synchronous. By treating the photons in telescopes as representing a single spatial slice of the source, standard models have been forced to interpret all observed distortions as spatial deflections caused by mass. It has been shown that this <em>Isochrony Axiom</em> is an effective approximation that may break down in the presence of generalized metric couplings.</p>

<p>The <em>Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP)</em>, introduced in a companion paper (Smawfield 2025a), provides a corrected framework. Under TEP, "gravity" includes the phenomenology of differential proper-time accumulation. When the assumption of isochrony is relaxed, the "dark" signals in lensing maps can be modeled as <em>temporal-composite artifacts</em>—the projection of unmodeled time dilation onto the spatial image plane.</p>

<h3>7.2 Summary of Findings</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Phantom Mass from Dark Time:</strong> It was demonstrated that a gradient in proper-time accumulation across an image plane acts as a "temporal shear" on evolving sources. In a static reconstruction, this is mathematically indistinguishable from the gravitational shear of a dark matter halo. The "dark sector" may simply be the difference between the gravitational metric (which guides orbits) and the matter metric (which guides clocks).</li>

    <li><strong>The GW170817 "Speed Limit" is Nuanced:</strong> The standard multi-messenger constraint was deconstructed. Because the conformal component of the metric coupling preserves null cones, it is <em>invisible</em> to differential speed-of-gravity tests. Photons and gravitational waves share the common-mode dilation. The widely cited \(10^{-15}\) bound constrains only the disformal (cone-tilt) sector, accepted here as the "speed of transmission" limit, while the unconstrained conformal sector governs the "rate of proper time accumulation" responsible for dark matter phenomenology.</li>

    <li><strong>A New Observational Era:</strong> Two regimes for testing TEP are defined. In the conservative <em>Reference Envelope</em>, the effects are millisecond-scale and detectable only in high-time-resolution astrophysics (FRBs, pulsars). In the <em>Extended Regime</em>, where environmental screening and/or a revised operational mapping allow larger effective delays, TEP becomes a full dynamical alternative to particle dark matter.</li>
</ol>

<h3>7.3 Future Outlook: Time, Not Mass</h3>

<p>The persistence of the dark matter problem despite decades of particle searches suggests a potential error in the underlying premises. The error may lie in the treatment of time. By treating time as a passive parameter rather than an active dynamical field, there is a risk of blinding analysis to the true nature of the "dark" universe.</p>

<p>The path forward lies in <em>Chronometric Lensing</em>. The field must move beyond static mass-mapping and towards <em>chronometric mapping</em>—measuring the detailed arrival-time structure of the universe. If "dark matter" halos are actually "time dilation" halos, the definitive indicator will not be a particle recoil in a xenon tank, but a millisecond residual in a Fast Radio Burst. The focus of inquiry must shift from searching for missing mass to characterizing the dynamical structure of time.</p>

<h3>7.4 The Paradigm Shift</h3>

<p>Within the operational axioms adopted here, the phenomenology traditionally attributed to a particulate dark sector can be reinterpreted as the projection of two-metric time transport onto inference pipelines that assume isochrony. The anomalies are real; the claim is that their standard "missing mass" interpretation is not unique once the Isochrony Axiom is relaxed.</p>
<p>The observational program outlined herein—time-domain lensing of fast transients, precision strong-lens residual timing, and source-variability-dependent shear consistency tests—provides a viable route to distinguish particle dark matter from a temporal-composite channel while maintaining a conservative Reference Envelope baseline anchored to existing multi-messenger constraints, thereby offering a promising avenue for resolving the dark matter problem.</p>
